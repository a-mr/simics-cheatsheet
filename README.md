# Simics Cheat Sheet

[Intel/WindRiver Simics](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/645996/30403/simics-simulator-public-release-preview.html?)
is a full-system simulator (similar to [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/)
by its ideas) for many platforms, particularly Intel ones.

This cheatsheet covers the basics of Simics usage and programming in DML 1.4
language, using Simics script, and C/Python API.
